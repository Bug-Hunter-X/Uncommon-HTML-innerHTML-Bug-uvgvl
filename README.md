# Uncommon HTML Bug: Unexpected innerHTML Behavior

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to the use of `innerHTML` in HTML. The bug involves unexpected behavior when appending content to an element that already has content using `innerHTML`.

## Description
The primary issue lies in how `innerHTML` handles nested structures.  While this specific example might seem to function correctly initially, it reveals a potential problem that could cause unexpected outcomes in larger projects with complex nested elements.
