<body>
  <div id="myDiv">
    This text is initially visible.
  </div>
  <script>
    //Incorrect use of innerHTML leading to unexpected behavior
    document.getElementById("myDiv").innerHTML = document.getElementById("myDiv").innerHTML + "<p>This paragraph should be added.</p>";
    //The above line is incorrect in certain scenarios. In this example, it may appear to work but adding a <p> tag inside a <div> that already has innerHTML will result in a nested structure. This can become a bigger issue in more complex scenarios.
